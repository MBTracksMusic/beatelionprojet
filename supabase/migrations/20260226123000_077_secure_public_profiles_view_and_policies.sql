/*
  # Secure public profile exposure with a minimal public view

  - Adds `public.public_producer_profiles` for public producer rendering.
  - Adds `public.my_user_profile` for owner-only full profile reads.
  - Restricts direct SELECT on sensitive columns from `user_profiles`.
  - Keeps anon compatibility for legacy public joins while removing authenticated global reads.
