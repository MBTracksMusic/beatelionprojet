  # Founding trial producers visibility in leaderboard

  Problem:
    All leaderboard views/functions filter by `is_producer_active = true`.
    Founding producers assigned via a campaign get `can_access_producer_features = true`
    but `is_producer_active` stays `false` (controlled exclusively by the Stripe trigger).
    This made ALL founding-trial users invisible in every leaderboard and matchmaking query.

  Fix:
    Add a founding-trial-active condition everywhere `is_producer_active = true` is used
    as a visibility gate. A user is considered "active" for leaderboard purposes if ANY
    of these is true:
      1. is_producer_active = true  (existing Stripe subscription)
      2. Active founding trial:
           producer_campaign_type IS NOT NULL
           AND founding_trial_start IS NOT NULL
           AND the referenced campaign is_active = true
           AND now() < founding_trial_start + trial_duration

    Admins (role = 'admin') are excluded from all leaderboards — they manage the
    platform and do not participate in battles.

  Changes (all CREATE OR REPLACE / DROP+CREATE — additive, non-breaking):
    Drop order matters: season_leaderboard → leaderboard_producers (dependency chain).
    1. get_leaderboard_producers()     — core leaderboard function
    2. season_leaderboard VIEW         — dropped first (depends on leaderboard_producers)
    3. leaderboard_producers VIEW      — dropped+rebuilt (wraps get_leaderboard_producers)
    4. season_leaderboard VIEW         — recreated (depends on leaderboard_producers)
    5. weekly_leaderboard VIEW         — independent view, updated
    6. suggest_opponents()             — 3 ELO-range blocks, all updated
    7. reset_elo_for_new_season()      — ELO reset UPDATE at end of function

  Grants: identical to the originals in migrations 143 / 144 / 070000.
